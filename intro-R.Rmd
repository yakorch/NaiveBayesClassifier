## 1. R as a calculator

#### Try to predict the outcomes of the following operations before running the chunk

```{r}
log(100); log10(100); log(100, 10)     # logarithms
sin(pi / 2); tan(pi / 2)                  # trig
sqrt(1 / 2^2)                           # squares and roots
exp(cos(pi / 2))# exponents
```

## 2. Sequences

```{r}
# increasing sequences
1:10; seq(1, 10); c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
# decreasing sequences
10:1; seq(10, 1); seq(10, 1, by = -1); seq(10, 1, length = 10)
# sequencs with rep = repeat
rep(1:5, 3); rep(1:5, each = 3); rep(1:5, c(3, 3, 3, 3, 3)); rep(1:5, rep(3, 5));

rep(1:5, length.out = 13)
# yeat another way
vctr <- seq(0, 1, by = .1); seq(1:length(vctr)); seq(along = vctr)
```

## 3. Vectors

```{r}
a <- seq(-1, 1, length = 5); a; a^2; 2 * a
#  can you guess what 2^a is?
print("Can you quess what 2^a is?"); 2^a
# indexing
a[1]; a[-1]
a[c(5, 1)]; a[-c(5, 1)]
# operations with 2 sequences
b <- c(2, -1); b
a + b; a^b
# logical 
a > 0; a[a > 0]; sum(a <= 0)
# changing vectors
a <- 1 / a; a
a[3] <- b[3]; a; b[3]
```

## 4. Manipulations with vectors

```{r}
a <- sin(seq(-1, 3, length = 10)); a
# increasing
sort(a)
# decreasing
sort(a, decreasing = TRUE)
# extrema 
max(a); min(a)
# ranking
rank(a)
# running max/min
cummax(a); cummin(a)
# sum and product of entries
sum(a); prod(a)
# locating what we need
which(a == max(a))
```

## 5. Data description

```{r}
sort(a); quantile(a, .25)
# median = splits in two halves
median(a); sum(a > median(a)); sum(a < median(a))
# mean
mean(a); sum(a) / length(a)
# variance
var(a); sum((a - mean(a))^2) / (length(a) - 1)
# standard deviation
sd(a); sqrt(var(a))
# percentiles = quantiles
quantile(a, c(.25, .75)); sum(a < quantile(a, .25)); median(a) == quantile(a, .5)
# summary
summary(a)
```

6) Task 1

- create a vector of length 100 running from -2 to 1
- create vector b that samples every other entry of a (those with even indices)
- form the sum, the difference, the product and the ratio of a and b
- find sum and product of entries of a; mean, variance, standard deviation, median, and quartiles of a
- summary of a

```{r}
a <- seq(-2, 1, length=100); a

b <- a[c(FALSE, TRUE)];

a + b; a * b; a - b; a / b

a^2; 2*a; mean(a); var(a); sd(a); median(a); quantile(a, 0.25); quantile(a, 0.75);
summary(a);

```
